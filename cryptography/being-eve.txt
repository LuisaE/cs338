------ Diffie-Hellman ------

1. Value of the shared key K: 36
   Method of computing: 

First let g = 11, p = 59, A = 57 and B = 44. Then we have the equations for the private keys:

57 = 11^a mod 59 -> answer in the form: 58n + 36
44 = 11^b mod 59 -> answer in the form: 58n + 15. 

A possible answer for the private keys are a = 36 and b = 15 (n = 0), so we check if the shared keys match:

shared key equations:  
K = 44^a mod 59 and a = 36 -> K = 36
K = 57^b mod 59 and b = 15 -> K = 36

The numbers match so we found our shared key = 36.

2. This wouldn't work with big integers because there would have many possible solutions, and it would require us
to check lots of numbers in the shared key equations. Here we were lucky that n = 0, but n could theorically be 
any positive number, so checking infinitely many solutions is not very practical.

Method of computing:

The factors of 5561 are {1, 67, 83, 5561}, therefore p and q are 67 and 83 (not necessarily in that order).
