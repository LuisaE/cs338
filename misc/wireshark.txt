TCP 3-way handshake for establishing a connection
1	192.168.8.128	129.6.15.29	TCP	47114 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM=1 TSval=1379999243 TSecr=0 WS=128
2	129.6.15.29	192.168.8.128	TCP	13 → 47114 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460
3	192.168.8.128	129.6.15.29	TCP	47114 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0
